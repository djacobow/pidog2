# PiDog2 software installation

To use the PiDog, you only need a little bit of software. So far, I only have a python-based library, but it should be easy to support other languages in the future.

## Install dependencies

The PiDog comes with a python library that interacts  with the Dog itself. It has simple setter / getters that should make accessing the PiDog's register a snap.

The main library is called pidog.py and it has very few special dependencies, but it has two:

1. It requires python3 (not the python2 that is common on mosts distros. I could probably make it 2/3 compatible,
       and perhaps will. But for now, if you are on a debian style OS:

   `sudo apt-get install python3`

2. It requires the RPi.GPIO library for Python. This may be installed by default on your OS, but if it isn't, then you can install it from the apt/yum repositories, or using pip. 

    I use Raspbian Stretch, so I can just do:

    `sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio`    

## Running


`pidog.py` is the main library. It includes routines for a simple bit-banged SPI implementation (bbSPI) and wrappers for 
accessing the PiDog registers. The wrappers will also convert register contents into more friendly representations for you
and return them as little JSON structs. 

`example.py` is a very simple example that uses pidog.py to initialize a PiDog object (and which also initializes the actual PiDog), resets it to the default reset values, and then,  in a loop calls feed()`which is just a wrapper that reset the countdown timer.

`dogcmd.py` is a very simple command-line utility that also allows accessing the pidog.py setter/getters from the command line. This should make it easy to "feed" the dog or make other adjustments from shell scripts.
   

Speaking of shell scripts,`shutdown_example.sh` is an example of a script that uses`dogcmd.py to set up the PiDog to shutdown and wakeup after a certain period, then it shuts down the Pi gracefully before the PiDog cuts the power.

I know this documentation is minimal, but the code is pretty small, too. It was my intention to keep it very simple so that it could also be reliable.

## Firmware version & upgrade

The firmware sketch and the rpi code should always be compatible from the same commit.  But as the code in this repo
advances, it may become incompatible with the existing firmware that is on your PiDog. This is especially likely if
you bought your PiDog from Amazon; it was sent to their warehouses awhile ago, so could be out of date.

If you run into issues using your PiDog, its firmware may be out of date. Updating is easy, however, and you do not
need a programmer. Instructions are in [flashing/flashing_instructions.md](./flashing/flashing_instructions.md)
