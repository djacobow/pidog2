# RPi-based PiDog2 Flashing Instruction

You can upgrade the firmware on the PiDog2 directly from a Raspberry Pi with no additional hardware (programmer, etc.)

You can get a firmware image directly form this repo (in `firmware_images/`, or you can create your own by building the sketch in this repo with the Arduino environment  (see `attiny84_sketch/fw_build.md`), or, of course, you can build your own firmware if you like.

## Instructions

1. First, install the avrdude programmer. Starting from Raspbian OS, will need to install the following package:

    `sudo apt-get install avrdude`
    
    Optionally, if you want to actually build firmware images yourself on the RPi, you can also install

    `sudo apt install avr-gcc binutils-avr`

    More optionally: if you want to run the Arduino IDE, it's probably best to get that from arduino.cc rather than get the     crufty old version in the repo.

2. Create a new avrdude configuration file

    Copy your system avrdude.conf file to a working location:

    ```sh
    cd <some workdir>
    cp /etc/avrdude.conf avrdude-gpio.conf
    ```

    Then use your favorite text editor to edit the file you just created and add the following lines to it. You can do this     anywhere in the file, but the bottom is nice:
  
      > There is a sample avrdude-gpio.config in this repo  that I have already edited, but you should copy the one from your system, in the case that it is already customized or comes from a newer version of avrdude.

    ```
    programmer
      id    = "rpi_pidog_gpio";
      desc  = "Program a PiDog from the RPi GPIO lines";
      type  = "linuxgpio";
      reset = ~24;
      sck   = 11;
      mosi  = 10;
      miso  = 9;
    ;
    ```

3. Disable the actual power switching

    The first step in programming an AVR chip is to reset it. Unfortunately, that will result in the power being immediately
    cut to the RPi.  That won't work at all!

    We need to make sure that doesn't happen. There are two ways to this:
     
             1. shutdown the RPi, remove the USB cable from the PiDog, and attach it instead to the RPi
             2. attach a jumper on the power pins, bridging the VCC and switched VCC pins. The power pins are the 2x2 header in the upper left, and when the jumper is in the correct position, it will be connecting the top and bottom pins on the RIGHT side. (When not in use, you can store the jumper on the left side.)


4. Check that the programmer can talk to the device

    (There is a script supplied to do this for you, `quick_test.sh`.)

    ```
    sudo avrdude -C avrdude-gpio.conf -c rpi_pidog_gpio -p t84
    ```
        With any luck, you'll get a response like this one:

    ```
    avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

    Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.00s

    avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e930c (probably t84)

    avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:DF, L:E2)

    avrdude done.  Thank you.
    ```

    If so, you are ready to proceed to the programming step. If not, try re-running the command with `-v` added to the end to get more verbose messages for diagnosis.

5. Now you are ready to reprogram the device. Get your firmware image in Intel .hex format (from the Arduimo IDE: Sketch => Export Compiled Binary) and issue the commands:

    ```sh
    avrdude -C avrdude-gpio.conf -c rpi_pidog_gpio -p t84 -v -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m
    avrdude -C avrdude-gpio.conf -c rpi_pidog_gpio -p t84 -v -U example_file.hex 
    ```

    The first command adjusts the "fuse" bytes and primarily sets the clock to 8 MHz. The second command stores the firmware. On subsequent firmware updates, only the first command is needed.

    If you just want to flash the firmware associated with the commit you have checked out, then just run this script:
    `reflash.sh`

 6. Remember that you removed removed the power from the PiDog or attached a jumper on the Vcc pins. Shutdown the Pi, remove the jumper (or reattach the USB cable to the PiDog) and restart.


That's it!
